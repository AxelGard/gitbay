                <h1 class="story-title">Once upon a time...</h1>
                <p>The founder of Scouting, Lord Robert Baden-Powell (B-P) was born in 1857 in England. He lived a busy
                    and adventurous life, and as a boy spent much of his spare time in open-air pursuits, hunting in the
                    woods, and joining his brothers in expeditions by land and in their boats. Thus he developed his
                    powers of observation and resourcefulness and acquired many useful skills.

                    He won a scholarship which gave him entry into the British Army, where he was sent to India and
                    served for many years. He tried out his ideas of training soldiers in “Scouting”, teaching them how
                    to develop experience in stalking and fending for themselves and to be observant of all signs that
                    would give them an advantage as soldiers. He set down his ideas in the book Aids to Scouting, which
                    was used as a textbook for many years.

                    As a soldier, Baden-Powell rose to public prominence during the war against the Boers in Africa at
                    the end of the 1800s. Most noteworthy was his leadership of the defending force in the siege of the
                    South African town of Mafeking. Baden-Powell returned to England as a national hero in 1899 having
                    successfully defended the town against the Boers.</p>

                <h2>The first Scout Camp</h2>
                <p>Baden-Powell was encouraged to set down his views on how he would apply Scouting to the training of
                    boys. He first conducted an experimental camp in 1907 on Brownsea Island off the Dorset coast of the
                    UK. With some 20 boys from all walks of life and suitable adult leaders, Baden-Powell taught the
                    boys what he meant by Scouting. They lived in tents, cooked their own food and learnt many valuable
                    skills through games.</p>

                <p>1 August 1907 is regarded as the beginning of the Scout Movement worldwide.</p>

                <h2>A best seller!</h2>
                <p>The camp was a great success and proved Baden-Powell’s ideas, so he tackled the task of writing down
                    his experience in a book. Scouting for Boys was first published in fortnightly parts, beginning 15
                    January 1908. Every issue sold out as soon as it hit the news stands, despite the cover price of 4d
                    which was expensive at the time. In fact, Scouting for Boysranks fourth in the best-selling books of
                    the 20th Century after the Bible, the Koran and Mao’s Little Red Book.</p>

                <p>Every other Wednesday until the end of March, boys (and girls) all over England eagerly awaited the
                    next issue ofScouting for Boys.</p>

                <h2>Movement is born</h2>
                <p>It was suggested that boys form themselves into Patrols within other organisations but boys didn’t
                    want to be school-Scouts, cadet-Scouts or brigade-Scouts, they simply wanted to be Scouts. Long
                    before the last instalment of Scouting for Boys had hit the book stands, Scout Patrols and Troops
                    had magically appeared all over Britain. Baden-Powell finally bowed to the inevitable and accepted
                    that Scouting would have to become a Movement in its own right.</p>

                <p>Two years later Baden-Powell retired from the army as a General to devote his life to this new
                    Movement called Scouting. A rally at the Crystal Palace, London, drew together 10,000 boys.</p>

                <h2>Scouting expands and grows</h2>
                <p>The Girl Guides were formed in 1910 by Baden-Powell’s sister, Agnes. In quick succession came the
                    Sea Scout Branch in the same year, Wolf Cubs in 1916, Rover Scouts in 1918 and the Special Test (now
                    “Extension”) Department in 1926. The Group system of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Rover Scouts under the
                    leadership of the Group Scoutmaster was established in 1927, Deep Sea Scouts in 1928, Air Scouts in
                    1941 and Senior Scouts in 1946 (now known as Venturer Scouts).</p>

                <p>Meanwhile Scouting spread to Australia, New Zealand and India in 1908 and other countries followed
                    shortly after. In 1909 Chile was the first country outside the British Empire to take up Scouting,
                    followed closely by France, the Scandinavian countries and the United States in 1910. Scouts of
                    China formed their first scout group in 1912. By 1937 over two and a half million Scouts from nearly
                    fifty countries were affiliated with the International Bureau which was set up to safeguard Scouting
                    and to prevent control drifting into the hands of the purely religious, political or military
                    bodies.</p>

                <h2>How we met</h2>
                <p>Fast forward to 1996 Taiwan, Ming-Hu Junior High School has started up its first ever girl scout
                    troop, and boy scout troop in the following year. And yeah... Here is where we first met, in 2006.
