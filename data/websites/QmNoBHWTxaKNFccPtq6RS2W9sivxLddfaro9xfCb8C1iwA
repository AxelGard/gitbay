      <h3>William Kelso Morrill Award</h3>
      <p>
	In April of 2021 i was honoured to receive from my department
	the William Kelso Morill Award for Excellence in Mathematics.
	This award is given to the PhD candidate who &ldquo;best
	displays the traits of William Kelso Morrill in his teaching,
	love of teaching, love of mathematics, and concern for
	students&rdquo;.
      </p>

      <p>I was nominated for this award by my students, one of whom
	wrote &ldquo;Teaches and simplifies material very well. Takes the
	time to work with students and gives a lot of feedback on homework
	and portfolio. Grades within a reasonable timeframe and is easy to
	reach out to. Reaches out to struggling students. Overall caring
	person.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction to Proofs: Course development assistant</h3>
      <p>
	In Spring of 2019 Prof. Riehl and i designed and ran an introductory course
	for mathematics. The course was split into three components: a
	&lsquo;standard&rsquo; introduction to proofs, an enquiry-based learning
	approach to metric spaces, and a discussion-format section on the notion of
	proof in mathematics.
      </p>

      <p>
	The first third of the course used the structure of the book &ldquo;How to
	Prove It&rdquo; by Velleman, and had homework generated by Prof. Riehl and
	i, as well as some extracted from the book.
      </p>

      <p>
	During the first third, for a change of perspective and so as to
	introduce notions of constructive mathematics, i lectured for a week
	on computer proof assistants. The class re-learnt propositional
	calculus through the use of
	the <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> computer proof assistant,
	as available online
	at <a href="https://x80.org/collacoq/">Collacoq</a>, and the goal was
	a modest reading comprehension of Coq code.
      </p>

      <p>
	The script for these lectures, containing an introduction to type
	theory, Coq, and Collacoq &ndash; to the extent necessary for, and phrased
	within the broader of the course &ndash; as well as reading exercises, is
	available here.
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="301/coq_lecture1.html">Lectures</a> as HTML file</li>
	  <li><a href="301/coq_lecture1.txt">Source code</a> for
	    lectures (processed by coqdoc to create the above)</li>
	</ul>
      <p>
	In addition i created a written homework sheet, with feedback from
	Prof. Riehl, on constructive mathematics,
	available <a href="301/301pset6.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the second third of the course we switched to an IBL
	(enquiry-based learning) format and explored some of the early
	theory of metric spaces. Students completed the appropriate
	(portion of) the appropriate script before class and took it in
	turns to present their difficulties or successes with the
	material to one another. Here are the scripts i designed, with
	editing and input from Prof. Riehl. These are all made available

      <h3>Mentor in and organiser for the JHU Directed Reading Programme</h3>
      <p>
	I have been a mentor in
	the <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/drp.html">JHU Directed
	  Reading Programme</a> since its inception. The programme pairs
	undergraduate students with graduate students for one-on-one
	independent studies over the course of a semester.
      </p>

      <p>
	Out of a desire to see the budding programme succeed, through 2018-2019 i
	helped organise the programme, and represented our then
	fledgling chapter at the 2018 Directed Reading Programme Network
	and Workshop at MIT.
      </p>

      <p>
	I have mentored projects on the following topics: Fundamentals of
	General Topology, Braid Group Representations and Knot Invariants,
	Category Theory, and Homotopy Type Theory.
      </p>

      <p>
	Abstracts of the projects may be found on
	the <a href="http://www.math.jhu.edu/drp.html">programme website</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>ODE Autumn 2019/Spring 2021: Portfolios experiment</h3>

      <p>
	As head teaching assistant
	to <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~brown/">Prof. Richard Brown</a>
	&ndash; director of undergraduate studies &ndash;, in the
	usually calculation-homework-centric differential equations
	&ldquo;service course&rdquo;, i helped construct and orchestrate
	an experiment in student evaluation. Despite a class size of
	175, we designed the course around semester-long digital
	portfolios: every week students were charged with creating
	&lsquo;artefacts&rsquo; covering some minimum amount of content,
	and we were careful to leave this task open-ended.
      </p>

      <p>
	The goal was to afford students the freedom to express,
	challenge, and reinforce their understanding in their terms, and
	in doing so emphasise a fundamental facet of mathematics:
	creativity. Initially most students produced text-based
	documents closely matching some of the example artefacts.
	However, with weekly small-group TA meetings focused solely on
	crafting these portfolio entries, students gained in confidence
	throughout the semester. They regularly created artefacts
	exceeding the minimum requirements, about topics they enjoyed,
	connections to other courses they had noticed, and work they
	were proud of. Moreover, the diversity in the style and medium
	of entries grew noticeably too.
      </p>

      <p>
	Most importantly, we the TAs spent the semester emphasising the
	room and need for creativity in engaging with and doing
	mathematics. Ultimately the course was ranked the highest among
	all service courses by the students.
      </p>

      <h3>Calculus III &amp; ODE: Head T.A. and WeBWorK admin.</h3>
      <p>
	In the Autumn of 2018 i was offered the role of Head Teaching
	Assistant for the Calculus III course at JHU. The instructor,
	Prof. Riehl, decided that the course should have an online
	homework component and so we settled on
	the <a href="http://webwork.maa.org/">WeBWorK</a> platform.
      </p>
      <p>
	During the course i was responsible for managing the online
	platform, exporting grades, and at times, programming new
	exercises for the students.
      </p>

      <p>
	Owing to my experience in this position and my desire to see an
	online homework platform succeed, i was offered the same role
	for the course in the Autumn of 2019, though this time the
	instructor was <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~brown/">Prof.
	  Richard Brown</a>, the director of undergraduate studies. I was
	offered the same role in Autumn of 2020 and Spring 2021, again
	with Prof. Richard Brown, but this time for the ODE course.
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction to Calculus: Sole instructor</h3>
      <p>
	In Autumn of 2017 i was offered the chance to run the introductory
	mathematics course designed to bridge high-school and university
	level mathematics. Although there was an assigned course text, the
	syllabus, homework, tests and exams, teaching, and marking were
	left entirely to me. Thus, i designed and ran the course.
      </p>

      <h3>Intersession Course: Primary Instructor</h3>
      <p>
	In January of 2017 several colleagues and i applied for, and were
	granted permission by the university to run an intersession course
	on recreational mathematics entitled &ldquo;Recreational Mathematics
	for All&rdquo;. We divided up the course into several, related topics
	and each co-organiser was given a few lectures to develop their
	topic. I lectured on secret sharing, building on the number theory
	that had gone before, and paving the way to the group theory that
	would come after. For evaluation the students submitted an
	elaboration of a topic that they had met during the course.
      </p>

      <h3>Cumulative experience as a teaching assistant</h3>
      <p>
	I have served as a Teaching Assistant in courses concerning: Real
	Analysis, Introductory Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Differential
	Equations, The Calculus Sequence, and String Theory.
      </p>
